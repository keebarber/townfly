# Event Roulette!
Looking for something to do tonight?  Maybe spend some time with friends or family this upcoming weekend?  You *could* get lost shuffling through the interwebs looking for something interesting to do.  Or you could try a fun and novel approach!

## Initial Concept
Our app accesses the Facebook API to find public events within a certain distance of a given location.  The app will then serve up a random event for the user to consider.  If the user is interested, he or she can access the event page on Facebook for further details.  If not, the user may instead discard the suggested event and move on to the next.

## MVP (Minimum Viable Product)
- "Tinder" style UI
- Search by ZIP code
- Sort results by date/time
- Filter by category (Education, Fitness, Hotel, Food and Beverage, et cetera)
- String search (filter results by keyword)
- Access Facebook event page for further details

## Stretch Goals
- Detect user location
- Dynamic distance (find events within 1K, 5K, 10K+ of current location)
- Use interactive Google Map to pinpoint location
- Facebook login vs. account-free access
- "Bucketing" of events (save interesting events for later recall)
